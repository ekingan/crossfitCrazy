## Description

>My web app, xfitfinder, is designed to help users discover, rate, and review crossfit affliates around the world.
>As a crossfit fanatic, there are certain qualities I know to look for when choosing an affliate. The rating and review
section aims to address the intricacies of choose a gym, whether traveling or at home.

## User Stories:
* I am looking for a new crossfit gym and would like to compare the options in my area.

* When I am traveling, I want to see what affliates are located near by.

* I would like to compare how different crossfit affliates compare to each other from around the world.

##Technologies Used
>Ruby on Rails, Geolocator, Google Maps, PostgresQL, Heroku, Raty (for star ratings)

##General Approach
>I begain by getting authentication working. Then I set up my models and controllers for Gym, Review, and User.
>I made sure all views, controllers, and models were talking to each other, then I got star ratings working.
>I spent a long time trying to style it too. Styling is still not complete.

##Installation Instructions
>To run this app, you will need to seed the database first to populate the gym model.


## Site Flow:
>A user arrives to the site and see top rated affliates. They can search by location or name to find specific gyms.
>To find out more information on an affiliate, they may click on the name of the affiliate to read user reviews and 
>find details on location, website, phone number, etc. They can choose to sign up and leave reviews for any affiliate.
